      <h2 class="heading">Cluster Meet <i>!</i></h1>
      <p>
        The most important thing I learned during the Cluster Meet is that hardwork and determination pays off. When I saw how hard the
        athletes were working, I was surprised at first, but then when they won, I realized that it wasn't in vain and that hard work can truly
        get you somewhere. If I were to apply this in real life, I would try and apply this to my academics. After realizing such a lesson, I want to try it for myself
        and work hard to earn good grades like how the atletes earned their well-deserved wins. Unfortunately, I did not participate in the event that much since I was not a 
        player myself, but I tried to cheer for LPSCI as much as I could. If I were to explain this to a classmate, I would tell them about the hardwork of everyone involved,
        and how it is important to reflect those values onto ourselves, and how if we are determined enough, we can achieve anything we put our minds to. I think having an event like the Cluster Meet is 
        important because it shows us the true fighting spirit of LPSCI, and how we compete with fairness and persistence. It also highlights the abilities of the athletes who are underappreciated because we 
        are a mainly academic focused school.

      <h2 class="heading">Science Month <i>!</i></h1>
      <p>
        If you were to ask me what was the most important thing I learned during Science Month, it would be how science is everywhere and we should always stay open and curious
        to learn. With these values, I can apply these to my academics once again. After Science Month, I want to try and be more curious about the world around us and stay eager to learn.
        I want to keep acquiring knowledge about everything around us, and continue to study hard. Luckily, I was able to actually participate in one of the events this time! After achieving
        a high enough score to advance past the elimination round, I was able to join the Quiz Bee. Although I didn't place in the Top 3, I was grateful to have participated and seen just how 
        knowledgable my fellow peers are. To explain this to a classmate, I would tell them that Science Month was a month filled with abundant learning and curiousity. Everyone around seemed 
        eager to learn more about science, and we should continue to do so. Science Month was an important event because it helps learners learn more things,  and it assists them in expanding their
        knowledge, not just through studying, but also through the various activities the school planned for that month.

      <h2 class="heading">Buwan ng Wika<i>!</i></h1>
      <p>
        As a Filpino, Buwan ng Wika was a very significant month to me, and there were a lot of important things I learned during the event. I learned that
        our culture and our language should be respected and honored, not something to be forgotten. We need to continue to teach the future generations about our culture as Filipinos in order
        to continue to honor it. To apply this in real life, I will try my best to improve my Filipino skiills. I mostly speak English, but I recognize that I need to improve in Filipino as well,
        because our language is a big part of our culture, and I wouldn't want to forget it. Through the activity of our Deklamasyon in Filipino, I was able to participate in the event a bit. Though I was
        not chosen to become the representative of our section, it was still a lot of fun to learn and recite a poem in Tagalog to my classmates. If I were to explain this to a classmate, I would tell them 
        that Buwan ng Wika was a month full of celebrating our Filipino culture, and recognizing our heritage. In my opinio, this month was especially important as a person who mostly speaks straight English. 
        It was nice to be reminded of our beautiful culture and language, and I was grateful that this event at school doesn't let us forget about it, and teaches people like me about it.

      <h2 class="heading">Intrams<i>!</i></h1>
      <p>
        After Intrams, I learned a lot about teamwork, sportsmanship, and unity. I saw those values in everyone who participated, through their participation in the games, their ability
        to respect each other despite losing to one another, and how well their teamwork played out during the games. The players were all united by their desire to win, yet they treated each other
        in a civil manner, and was able to keep their sportsmanship. I would love to reflect these kinds of values in my own life, just in everyday scenarios. I want to have that kind of teamwork and sense unity with groups
        that I may be in. Unfortunately I was unable to join this year, I actively cheered for the team my class was a part of. It felt good to support my classmates and teammates, even if I myself wasn't playing.
        To teach a classmate about this, I would tell them about the cramaderie everyone shared and how it worked in their favor, I would tell them Intrams was a season for teamwork and cooperation.
        This event was important to show everyone that if you cooperate with others, you all will be able to achieve great things together. Also, it was important to show people to continue to have sportsmanship 
        even if they lost something.

      <h2 class="heading">Teachers Day<i>!</i></h1>
      <p>
        Teachers was such an important day for not just teachers, but to students as well! To give the teachers a break, this time, I taught myself the importance of valuing our teachers.
        I recognized how important it is to give the teachers their own break sometimes, because they work hard as well! To apply this to real life, I try my best to make my teachers work load
        much lighter, and try my best to behave so as not to cause them any trouble, and to listen in their class. I know how bad it must be to have to deal with difficult students, so I want to 
        value my teachers by being the best student I can be. I participated in our Teachers Day celebration through our party! We played a few games and ate food with our adviser, Sir Gabriel Esterella,
        and tried our best to show him just how significant he is to us. An explanation I would give to a classmate about this event is teling them the importance of our teachers, because thats what the day was about.
        I would tell them it was a day full of appreciation for those who guide us and give us knowledge, and we should continue to appreciate them even without that day. This event was extremely important because, 
        teachers are human too, and they need to take breaks every once in a while. They work hard everyday, and its nice to show them how much we care about them. It was nice the school held an event just to show the worth
        of those who teach us everyday.

      <h2 class="heading">AP Month<i>!</i></h1>
      <p>
       Last but not the least, AP Month! Though AP Month is still currently ongoing, I have already learned quite a lot from the event! The month was mostly centered around the Philippines, and it was fun to learn
       about just that! After the lecture held at the start of the month, I learned about the value of fighting for the rights of your country, and the importance of defending your country. To apply this in real life,
       I will try to be more educated on the news surrounding our country and try to educate others on it as well. Afterall, it is important to defend the country we live in. I was able to participate
       a bit through the activity our teacher provided us, the cartooning! I tried my best on my work, and it was fun to participate in a little activity like that. If I were to explain this event to a classmate,
       I would tell them it was about educating yourself about anything Araling Panlipunan related, and how the events I remember were mostly surrounding the Philippines itself. This month was especially important because
       we need to educate ourselves more about the country we come from, and even live in.
