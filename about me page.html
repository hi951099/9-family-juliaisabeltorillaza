           Hi! I'm Julia! My friends have described me as caring, lively, clumsy, and shy at first but extremely loud when you get to know me! I'm very passionate about the things I like, and can often talk about them for long periods of time! If you were to ask me what is my aspiration in life is, its to move out of the country and become a veterinarian one day.

            My favorite character of all time would definitely be Albedo from Genshin Impact! He's been my favorite for 4 years and counting, and I absolutely adore everything about his design, personality, and story in the game! In my free time, I like to collect merchandise of him when I have enough money saved up! He is also the theme of this website. (‚åí‚ñΩ‚åí)‚òÜ

            My favorite animes/mangas are Haikyuu, Blue lock, Gokurakugai, The Guy She Was Interested in, Phantom Busters, and etc. I'm a huge fan of all of the series listed, and reading/watching them are a huge stress relief for me whenever I have time to do so!
          </p>
          <p class="right-text">Some of my favorite artists include Laufey, Sabrina Carpenter, Faye Webster, Red Velvet, Twice, and TxT! I love western music, especially the R&amp;B and Pop genres, but I am also a very big kpop stan and a huge fan of Korean pop music.</p>

      <p class="friends-text"> I love socializing with others, especially with my friends! My friends are the people I consider the most dear to me, the absolute loves of my life, and I have a big space in my heart for them! 
        Whenever I'm struggling or not feeling the best, my friends are always there to support me and comfort me no matter what.
        I love spending time with them, because they always make me feel happy and I have a lot of fun with them. 
        With them, I am able to grow as a person and discover new things about myself.

        My most memorable event with my main group of friends would be the time we went swimming together at Azure Beach Resort during the Summer of 2024. That day gave me
        a lot of good memories and experiences that I still look back on fondly. I had a lot of fun that day just hanging out with my friends,
        and I would love to have another experience like that with them again one day.

      <p class="friends-text">
        Even if some of my friends are from other schools, I still love them as much as my friends who are in the same school as me.
        I try my best to always be there for them, even if we aren't together that much physically! I'm truly grateful that I have such amazing friends,
        and I hope to always keep them close to me no matter what happens in the future.

    <p class="family-text"> My family is a very big part of my life. It consists of my dad, my mom, my three older brothers, and me! We are all very different, but we are still quite close. I am especially close to my third brother, since we are quite
      close in age and we have the same humor. Although I might fight with them
      quite a lot, I truly do love my brothers and am thankful they support me no matter what. They guide me throughout my life and they keep me safe and protected.
      I feel assured knowing that no matter what I do, they will always be there to guide and support me.
